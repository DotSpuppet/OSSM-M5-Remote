## !!! It does not Work with the Official OSSM Firmware !!!
This Branch is needed: https://github.com/ortlof/OSSM-Stroke

The Cable remote is obsolete with this firmware. If you want to go back you need to flash the OSSM orginal firmware back.

You can Easy flash the OSSM Mainboard with this [Online Flasher](https://openlust.org/lust-remote/lustremote-firmware/).

## 3D Printed Parts Needed:

| Quantity | Part | Information |
|----------|------|-------------|
| 1x | M5_curved_w6mm+5.stl Thanks to "Hoodlatch" KM Discord | There is a specific version for the wider Adafruit LIPO battery. Print with the base side facing down, 6 walls 20% Infill |

Filament - A good quality PLA works well. While there are no threads it is recommended that your printer is well calibrated.  

## Operation, or how do I use it?

1. Power on the OSSM and let it home.
2. Power on the OSSM M5 Remote.
3. Press the left encoder to select 'Connect'
4. You can verify it is connected by looking in the top left corner, it should say 'connected'.
5. You can now begin use. You'll need to set the speed, depth and stroke to more than 0 and press the middle key to start. Start the speed out slow.
